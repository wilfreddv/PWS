# PWS

This is the final project I did in highschool, when I was 18 years old.

## What does it do?

This project is a simple website which allows teachers to reserve classrooms.
It is made using Python/Flask.

## How to install?

This requires at least python3.5. Clone the repository and run `install.sh`. This will create the databases necessary and necessary packages.

### Notes

This version is a public version, not the actual project I handed in. The main difference between these versions is that the original version automatically filled out classrooms depending on the schedule on my school's website.
